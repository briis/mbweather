# Meteobridge Weather for Home Assistant
This a *Custom Integration* for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). It combines real-time weather readings from a Meteobridge Weather Logger and Forecast data from *Dark Sky*.

[*Meteobridge*](https://www.meteobridge.com/wiki/index.php/Home) is a small device that connects your personal weather station to public weather networks like "Weather Underground". This allows you to feed your micro climate data to a weather network in the Internet and to have it there visible from wherever you are. Meteobridge also has many ways of delivering data to your local network, and this furthermore reduces the dependencies for Cloud Services when you need very local Weather Data.<br>
Meteobridge can be delivered as complete HW and SW packages, or there is a SW solution that you then can install yourself on specific HW. 
If you have any Davis Weatherstation I would recommend the Meteobridge Nano SD solution or else the Meteobridge PRO solution.
